- Our topic is the 2019 Canadian Election Study, a large-scale survey measuring the attitudes of Canadians on important political, social, and economic issues before the most recent Federal election.

Reason for selection:
- It's a rich dataset with many angles for analysis.

Description of source data:
- It's a survey on the 2019 Federal election covering a multitude of topics potentially relevant. It's a mostly multiple choice survey with 37,822 responses.

Question we hope to answer:
- Predict party preference based on survey data

## Communication Protocols

We're using a group on slack to communicate

## Machine Learning Model

We will attempt to predict respondents' political party preferences based on their demographic information and their issue priorities. We plan to use a supervised machine learning model such as Random Forest or Ensemble Classifier to predict party preference.

## Database

The dataset is currently stored in a CSV file in the github repository. Data will be entered into a PostgreSQL database that will be connected to the final machine learning model.
